## Synopsis

This is a [cloud-init][] OS definition for [Ganeti][].  It injects the
meta-data and user-data directly into file system of the target host, to be
picked up by the [NoCloud][] data source.

This currently does not work with Rocky 9 cloud images.  We have a
solution/workaround to be committed soon which will require attaching an
generated ISO image on first boot via command line options.

There are plans from the Ganeti project to develop two new providers:

  * [instance-simpleimage][] will deploy a fixed image.
  * [instance-cloudimage][] will deploy a cloud-init image using metad.

The latter should provide an attractive alternative to the current provider
when available.

## Usage

### Preparation

Obtain [cloud-init images][openstack-obtain-images] for your guest Operating
System.  The image is expected to be in qcow2 format by default, but other
formats supported by `qemu-img` can be selected by the OS variant
definition.

Place the needed cloud-init images to `/var/cache/ganeti-cloudimg` and
distribute them to all nodes.  The expected file name of an image is
specified in the corresponding configuration file found under
`/etc/ganeti/nocloud/variants/`.  To add a missing OS variant, create the
configuration file and add the name to `/etc/ganeti/nocloud/variants.list`.
The variant configuration supports the following variables:

  - `IMAGE_FILE` is the filename of the image. This option is required.
  - `IMAGE_FORMAT` is passed to the `-f` option of `qemu-img`, by default
    `qcow2`.
  - `IMAGE_DIR` is the directory where to look for images, by default
    `/var/cache/ganeti-cloudimg`.
  - `IMAGE_ROOTFS_PARTNO` is the partition number of the root filesystem
     in the image. Used when adding cloud config.

Next, put your [cloud config data][cloud-config] under
`/etc/ganeti/nocloud/user-data/`.  The OS creation script will look for
`${OS_VARIANT}.yml` then `default.yml`. You may find [these cloud-config
examples][cloud-config-examples] handy.  Alternatively provide user data by
setting the `cloud_userdata` OS parameter to a list of sources, see the
documentation of this parameter below.

### VM Creation

Once the needed image is in place, the VM can be created by specifying
`nocloud+variant` as the OS, where `variant` is one of
`/etc/ganeti/nocloud/variants.list`:

    gnt-instance add -s 7G -o nocloud+ubuntu-18.04 vm1.example.org

### Static Network Configuration

For static IP configuration, specify the `network` and `ip` parameters for
the interface with e.g. `--net 0:network=local,ip=172.16.0.20`.  Also, if
you pass `-O static_host_interface=0` then all IPs from the DNS A and AAAA
records for the host will be added to the first interface, in which case the
`ip` network parameter may be omitted.  This allows creating IPv6-only VMs
or VMs with multiple IP numbers.

If you also provide the `name` parameter, the generated network
configuration will instruct cloud-init to rename the interface accordingly.

DNS configuration can be passed though the OS parameters `dns_nameservers`
and `dns_search` which are comma-separated lists of IPs and domains,
respectively.

## OS Parameters

### `cloud_userdata`

A comma-separate list of user-data sources.  The sources will be merged
using the [cloud-init merging algorithm][cloud-init-merge] which can be
configured with a `merge_how` key as documented on that page. The following
kinds are supported:

  - `file:<path>` includes the file at `<path>` on the Ganeti node, which
    can be absolute or relative to `/etc/ganeti/nocloud/user-data`.
  - `script:<path>` includes the standard output of running `<path>` on the
    Ganeti node. The path is relative to `/etc/ganeti/nocloud/user-data` if
    not absolute. To run the script on the VM, use `file:<path>` instead.
  - `base64:<data>` includes the base 64 decoding of `<data>`.
  - `<url>` will be delivered to cloud-init as is, where schemes recognized
    as belonging to URLs include `http`, `https`, `ftp`, `sftp`, `tftp`, and
    `scp`.

An example `user-data/default.yml` for Ubuntu can be found in
`examples/ubuntu`.

### `dns_nameservers` and `dns_search`

Comma-separated lists of name servers and domains to search. These are added
to all configured networks.

### `static_host_interface`

If set to a Ganeti network interface number, this interface will be set up
to handle the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with the instance name
according to DNS.
